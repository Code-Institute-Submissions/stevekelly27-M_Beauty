# UX

## Strategy 

This website was designed and implemented with Django, Python, HTML, and CSS.
It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface where customers can browse through the skincare products, or can choose a service provided and make a booking.
The site offers an inbuilt stock system to ensure users cannot buy things that are not currently in stock. Once signed in, users can save an address to their profile for easy and convenient checkout. Once a user makes a booking they can check the time and date of the booking once the user is signed through a view bookings link and can also cancel a booking.
